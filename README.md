#### Title
Employee Manager

# Description
An application that allows non-developers to view and interact with employee information within the database known as Content Management Systems.

# Reason
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this application, I became the architect and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
